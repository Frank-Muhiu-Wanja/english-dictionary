# English Dictionary ðŸ“–

This is an English Dictionary project.  
It allows users to search for words and fetch their meanings using a dictionary API.

## Features
- Search for any English word  
- Fetch definitions directly from an API  
- Simple and easy-to-use  

## Purpose
I created this project to practice with APIs and to build a useful tool for looking up word meanings.

## How it Works
1. Enter a word in the search box  
2. The project calls an external dictionary API  
3. The meaning are displayed  

## Future Improvements 
- Add synonyms and antonyms  
- Improve design with more styling  

## License
This project is open-source under the MIT License.
